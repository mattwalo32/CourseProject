# Project Overview

## Technologies
#### Backend
Use Python 3.7 for all of backend (scraping data, sentiment analysis, similarity measure). 
Flask for the backend.

#### Frontend
NodeJS 14.15.0 with ReactJS for the frontend
Yarn for package manager

### Scraping API data - 10 hours (Zoheb)
-   Learn specifics about API usage
-   Get movie ID from movie title
-   Get reviews from movie ID
-   Download and parse movie reviews
-   Data from **[https://developers.themoviedb.org/](https://developers.themoviedb.org/)**
  
### Sentiment Analysis - 15 hours (Leo)

### Similarity Measure - 10 hours (Zoheb)
-   Take a list of user rankings and list of generated rankings
-   Output a numerical representation of similarity
-   This requires a bit of experimenting so it will take extra time, we test multiple techniques to find a suitable solution:
-   Ex: Try MAP, gMAP, simple difference, VSM,...      

### Web Interface - 30 hours (Matthew)

-   Build a web interface to interface with the user
-   Problems to solve:
-   How to make it intuitive for users?
-   How to communicate between python backend and JavaScript frontend
